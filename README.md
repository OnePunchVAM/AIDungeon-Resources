## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is this? What is AI Dungeon?** <br />
<sub>AI Dungeon is an AI-assisted text adventure game created by [Latitude](https://latitude.io/) and based on the research of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Some people have compared it to playing [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) with an AI as the [dungeon master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKMFLPtmSoQ). For more information, see [AI Dungeon's own About page](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/about).</sub>

**How exactly does it work?** <br />
<sub>If you want to know more about the AI (specifically the language models AI Dungeon was trained on), read [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) paper on them [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). <br />
For more about AI Dungeon's side of things regarding how it processes user input and generates output, users like [Rinter](https://github.com/RinterWaptor) and [birb/valahraban](https://github.com/valahraban) have done an *incredible* job compiling guides and documentation from various users on much of the inner workings of AI Dungeon. See the links above for more info.</sub>

**Does the AI learn from my input?** <br />
<sub>Yes and no. While the AI will learn from and react to your input within the context of a specific story/adventure, that learning will not be fed back into the greater AI model itself or be persistent in any way across scenarios. The more you feed the AI within a specific adventure, the more it will use that (within the consideration of some technical limitations) moving forward within that same adventure.</sub>

**Why is the AI so dumb? How do I make the AI more consistent?** <br />
<sub>While AI Dungeon is certainly capable of adapting to almost any situation or input and uses one of the most advanced and powerful AI learning models for natural language processing currently available, *it's not magic*. The AI was trained on quite a large number of texts, but that also makes it's understanding limited only to anything present from those texts. Keep in mind that the default (free) AI model referred to as Griffin was trained on far far fewer texts than the premium (paid) model referred to as Dragon (13x as many as Griffin). Many of the AI's quirks come from the limitations of this training, the specific texts each given model was trained on, and even the way in which AI Dungeon itself has been developed over time. <br /> 
*HOWEVER*, many of these quirks can be easily remedied with just a little consideration to these limitations by simply structuring your inputs with a little more care. Most power users tend to use one of several [community-discovered formats](https://github.com/valahraban/AID-World-Info-research-sheet/blob/main/AID%20WI%20Research%20Sheet.md#world-info-and-formatting) for interacting with the AI in their stories. This formatting (often accompanied by some restrained brevity of input detail) can honestly make all the difference in the quality of your experience with AI Dungeon and is *highly* recommended for all users. When used along with other advanced features such as world info entries, custom scripts, and  the Dragon AI model, AI Dungeon quickly ascends much closer to the standards most people imagine when they hear the term "advanced artificial intelligence".</sub>

**I have other questions!** <br />
<sub>I suggest consulting the official channels such as the [site FAQ](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/frequentlyAskedQuestions), [Discord](https://discord.gg/JpgsTF3), or other community forums listed above. Most users are fairly friendly and willing to help if you ask nicely, though I will strongly recommend doing a bit of your own searching for answers via the resources available first!</sub>

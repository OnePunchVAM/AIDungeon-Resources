# AI Dungeon Resources
Scripts, documentation, research, and other resources I've found or made that are useful for getting more out of AI Dungeon.

The purpose of this repository is to make it as easy as possible for new and casual users to dig into the more advanced aspects of AI Dungeon as well as to compile advanced community resources and information in one place.

<sub>**Disclaimer**: I am *not* associated with Latitude or AI Dungeon in any way. This is *not* an official resource nor is it intended to replace the official documentation or any of the vastly superior community resources referenced or linked herein. The *sole* purpose of this document is to somewhat better ease inexperienced users into more advanced usage of AI Dungeon without having to scour all corners of the web or community forums for answers to questions that have been answered multiple times. <br /> 
I do not claim to have all the answers and will not respond to any specific questions or personal issues.</sub>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is this? What is AI Dungeon?** <br />
<sub>AI Dungeon is an AI-assisted text adventure game created by [Latitude](https://latitude.io/) and based on the research of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Some people have compared it to playing [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) with an AI as the [dungeon master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKMFLPtmSoQ). For more information, see [AI Dungeon's own About page](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/about).</sub>

**How exactly does it work?** <br />
<sub>If you want to know more about the AI (specifically the language models AI Dungeon was trained on), read [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/) paper on them [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). <br />
For more about AI Dungeon's side of things regarding how it processes user input and generates output, user [birb/valahraban](https://github.com/valahraban) has done an *incredible* job compiling documentation from various users on much of this process in their [research sheet](https://github.com/valahraban/AID-World-Info-research-sheet/blob/main/AID%20WI%20Research%20Sheet.md) along with [loads of other research](https://github.com/valahraban/AID-World-Info-research-sheet/tree/main/docs) you can find on their github. Alternatively, you can jump to the [How AI Dungeon Works In Detail](https://github.com/l-io-n/AIDungeon-Resources/wiki/Home/#how-ai-dungeon-works-in-detail) section in [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/l-io-n/AIDungeon-Resources/wiki).</sub>

**Does the AI learn from my input?** <br />
<sub>Yes and no. While the AI will learn from and react to your input within the context of a specific story/adventure, that learning will not be fed back into the greater AI model itself or be persistent in any way across scenarios. The more you feed the AI within a specific adventure, the more it will use that (within the consideration of some technical limitations) moving forward within that same adventure.</sub>

**Why is the AI so dumb? How do I make the AI more consistent?** <br />
<sub>While AI Dungeon is certainly capable of adapting to almost any situation or input and uses one of the most advanced and powerful AI learning models for natural language processing currently available, *it's not magic*. The AI was trained on quite a large number of texts, but that also makes it's understanding limited only to anything present from those texts. Keep in mind that the default (free) AI model referred to as Griffin was trained on far far fewer texts than the premium (paid) model referred to as Dragon (13x as many as Griffin). Many of the AI's quirks come from the limitations of this training, the specific texts each given model was trained on, and even the way in which AI Dungeon itself has been developed over time. <br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*HOWEVER*, many of these quirks can be easily remedied with just a little consideration to these limitations by simply structuring your inputs with a little more care. Most power users tend to use one of several [community-discovered formats](https://github.com/valahraban/AID-World-Info-research-sheet/blob/main/AID%20WI%20Research%20Sheet.md#world-info-and-formatting) for interacting with the AI in their stories. This formatting (often accompanied by some restrained brevity of input detail) can honestly make all the difference in the quality of your experience with AI Dungeon and is *highly* recommended for all users. When used along with other advanced features such as world info entries, custom scripts, and  the Dragon AI model, AI Dungeon quickly ascends much closer to the standards most people imagine when they hear the term "advanced artificial intelligence".</sub>

**I have other questions!** <br />
<sub>I suggest consulting the official channels such as the [site FAQ](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/frequentlyAskedQuestions), [Discord](https://discord.gg/JpgsTF3), or other community forums listed above. Most users are fairly friendly and willing to help if you ask nicely, though I will strongly recommend doing a bit of your own searching for answers via the resources available first. Don't be lazy!</sub>

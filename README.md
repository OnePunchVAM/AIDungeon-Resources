# AI Dungeon Resources
Mostly scripts and other resources I've found or made that are useful for getting more out of AI Dungeon.

#### ==Scripts==
###### My Own Scripts
Various AI Dungeon front-end and utility scripts I've made to either allow for enhanced user customization or to aid with some of the more complex parts of using AI Dungeon.<br />

###### Merged Community Scripts
Scripts from other community members that have been merged together to allow for one-click installation of otherwise independent features. To install, just download a zip, go into AI Dungeon's own "Scripts" section of a given scenario, hit the upload button and choose that zip.<br />

#### ==Research and Testing==
Various miscellaneous notes on AI Dungeon I've compiled for my own use.
